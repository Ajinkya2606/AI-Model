# 🤖 AI Response Model

A lightweight, flexible AI response generation model built to handle natural language queries with human-like replies. This project can be integrated into chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support systems, or any NLP-driven interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Context-aware conversation flow
- 🧠 Pre-trained transformer-based architecture (GPT, BERT, etc.)
- 🔌 Easy integration via API or CLI
- 🧪 Supports fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets
- 📦 JSON-based input/output format for seamless application integration

## 📚 Model Overview

This project uses a transformer-based model (like `GPT-2`, `GPT-3.5`, or custom fine-tuned models) to generate responses based on user input. It can handle tasks such as:

- Open-domain question answering
- Small talk/chat simulation
- Contextual follow-up replies
- Knowledge base querying

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-response-model.git
cd ai-response-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
